SketchyBar Setup
----------------------
The present config for sketchybar is done entirely in lua (and some C), using
[SbarLua](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SbarLua).
One-line install for sketchybar config (requires brew to be installed):
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/master/install_sketchybar.sh | sh
```

# Brew Installation

brew bundle --file ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile

# Setup Github authentication
Once you authenticate with gh, it can handle token management for you, so you wonâ€™t have to enter your PAT or update remote URLs manually.

Follow the prompts. You can choose to authenticate using a web-based flow (which is often easier) or by pasting a personal access token.

Using gh streamlines the process and makes it easier to manage your GitHub repositories without dealing directly with PATs or SSH configuration if you prefer HTTPS.

```bash
gh auth login
```
